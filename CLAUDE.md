# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Next.js template repository that currently contains only a README.md file. The repository appears to be in its initial state with no package.json, dependencies, or source code files present.

## Current State

- **Framework**: Next.js (based on repository name)
- **Structure**: Empty template - only contains README.md
- **Dependencies**: None configured yet
- **Configuration**: No configuration files present

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty template, you'll need to initialize the Next.js project first:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

After initialization, typical Next.js commands would be:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Notes for Future Development

- This repository is currently a blank slate
- When files are added, update this documentation with actual project structure and commands
- Consider adding TypeScript, testing framework, and other development tools as the project grows
